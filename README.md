# Experimental GraphQL Playground

Demonstration of experimental GraphQL features with the following transports:

- `graphql-helix`
- `graphql-ws`

Showcasing the following features with Fetcher implementations on GraphiQL:

- Query (HTTP, HTTP-Multipart, WebSocket)
- Mutation (HTTP, HTTP-Multipart, WebSocket)
- Query with @defer (HTTP-Multipart, WebSocket)
- Query with @stream (HTTP-Multipart, WebSocket)
- Subscription (WebSocket/SSE)
- Query with @live (WebSocket/SSE)

# Current issues

1. graphql-ws does not support `@stream`
2. graphql-helix with SSE-Z does not propagate GraphQL validation errors to the client properly

# Setup instructions

1. clone this repo

2. Make sure you have yarn and node v14 installed

3. Run `yarn install`

# Usage

Start the server with `yarn server:start`

Start the frontend `yarn start`

Visit `localhost:3000/__dev__/graphiql`

Execute some operations :)
